# FUML(WIP)
Flowing UML - Making System Design Fun Again

## What's This
A UML/PlantUML based dynamic system design simulator. It features:
* basic UML/PlantUML language support
* common system components with their behaviors simulated and configurable
* configurable live data flow simulation among system components
* mocking system components IO and isolation testing
* configurable system verifier 
* configurable load tester

## Motivation 
### Preface - A Rant About Software Eningeering Interview Prepping
Resignation notice sent, out of comfort zone by tossing myself back into the job market after 7 years, spending more time making music and gigging with [my band](https://www.carelesswhisper80s.com/) and I will be jobless in a month. It's 12:25am, failed a couple of interviews. Should I really be wasting time cooking up a pet project and not grinding [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) or reviewing system design concepts? IDK, the grind is too painful for me. I learn by making stuff. That's how I get good at things. For example, the moment I learned enough music theory to compose music, I got 10x better at playing the guitar because I love making music like [this](https://open.spotify.com/track/3U6RnQtctesNPAzms9bpxF?si=3e6e80ebd2ba4211). Please buy our album, it's good :).

I have no idea where this will go but I hope a pet project will make my ordeal through interview prepping less painful. I decide to pick a project that seems fun but I have little technical knowledge about and need to learn a lot from scratch, and hopefully it could produce something that will help me better deliver my thoughts within limited time (like an interview, live demo, lightning talks, etc). 

### My Casual Love for UML
I love seeing jibberish I write gets rendered into something beautiful, hence my love for [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/) and UML(https://www.uml.org/), as well as their visual companions [TexMaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) and [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/). I religiously write .tex files for my college papers, personal statements, and even music sheets using the [Latex and Lilypond combo](https://lilypond.org/doc/v2.21/Documentation/usage/latex). 

As for UML, I started using its visual companion PlantUML back in college to help translate my computer architecture class notes to diagrams because of its amazing ability to render from a very intuitive set of declarative syntax. Now as an engineer with a few years of experience under belt, I still regularly use PlantUML to help me visualize design and produce system diagrams for documentation, presentation. I know PlantUML is extremely customizable and offers a lot more than just connecting components and draw silly mindmaps, for example, it's preprocessing capability (similar to macros prefixed with `#`) and [stdlib](https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml-stdlib) that contains tons of icons and static assets that can be used to enhance diagram visual. But one thing I wish I could easily get out of PlantUML is live simulation of systems. I can already imagine how much more painless designing complicated distributed systems would be if we are able to properly simulate them every step of the way to verify business logic, consistency, availability and expected performance. Hence the birth of FUML. For this project, I may commit more than just casual and delve deeper into PlantUML's advance features and potentially rabbit-hole myself into its codebase. (Again, shouldn't I be grinding or grokking right now?!)
